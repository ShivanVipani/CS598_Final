# CS598 Final Project - Team 150
Navigating the Repo:
- main_root/ and sepens_folder/ are folders that are in my public Google Drive folder that I link in my notebook for you to use. They contain files that I've needed to modify to execute the original paper's code within Google Colab
- The ipynb and pdf at the root of the repo are of the notebook that I've provided you to be able to run in a short timespan (instructions on execution down below)
- saved_ensemble_weights/ contains the ensemble pickle files from my own independent executions, just available artifact files. Their notebooks and notebooks used for my other experiments (data splitting) are in the my_training_notebooks/ folder
- the model weight for the full model can be found in the Google Drive folder link under a folder called model_weights/
- the data files from the original paper and the data files I generated for my experiments are available in the Google Drive folder link under a folder called data/
- results.png is the table of results for full base model, uniform ensemble model, and weighted ensemble model on different experiments

Instructions to Run Code:
- To run my code, download the folder from my Google Drive link at the top of my notebook.
- Put that folder in the root directory of your Google Drive (My Drive/)
- Open DL4H_Team_150_FinalDraft.ipynb in Google Colab and connect to the GPU engine
- Run the first code cell to mount that folder onto Colab
- Execute all of the cells below and it should complete fully, surely taking under 10 minutes to clear the whole process
